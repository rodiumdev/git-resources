CONFIGURATIONS
    generate ssh key and link to git:
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" &&
        eval `ssh-agent -s` &&
        ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 &&
        clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

    set syntax coloring for readability:
        git config --global color.ui auto
